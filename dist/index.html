It is designed for you to set activities, or even make notes. You can press the pen icon to create a new card, delete an existing one using the trash can icon, or press the tick to indicate when an activity is finished. Once a task is finished it goes to the finished section and it can't be edited, but the information is still there for future reference. Note: The title is designed to be on one line only so if you start a new line, refresh the page so it functions normally.</div><div id="container"></div><button id="pen"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">stylus</span></button></body></html>
